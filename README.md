# GMT351-ProjectReport

Hello everyone.

The name of our project is customer satisfaction.

Our aim is to show who has supported the building that customers want to own and at what stage during the process from the foundation of any building construction to turnkey delivery, because a lot of engineers from cartographers to electricians support the construction of a building and that all kinds of paperwork are included in this order.  If the customer has complaints in the construction of the building, we want to highlight this project in order to express it easily depending on which area it is located in.

The programs we will use are PostgreSQL, NoSQL.
